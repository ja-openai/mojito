Dev Docs for Codex
==================

This directory holds design docs and working documents used by Codex during implementation. Record key decisions and context here.

Conventions
- Keep this separate from the public site content under `docs/`.
- Design docs live in `dev-docs/design/` and use numeric prefixes for ordering: `001-title.md`, `002-title.md`, ... (pad to 3+ digits).
- Increment the number for each new design doc to keep chronological order without exposing dates.

Tracker
- Use `dev-docs/tracker.md` to capture improvement ideas/tech debt before they become full design docs.
- When an item becomes active, promote it into a numbered design doc.
